# StabilityTester

Based on the original work done by ehoutsma, this tool runs through every frequency available on the Orangepi PC2 or rock64 using xhpl, depending on which script you run.

For optimal result you need to alter the cooling table to allow you to select all the frequencies up to 90C.
